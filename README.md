# CNN-image-classification
This is the CW1 of AI runs on Colab with ImageNet10 dataset.

## Tasks:

1.Try between 2 and 5 layers and choose some of architectural elements to test (filter size, max-pool kernel size, number/dimensions of fully-connected layers, etc.)

2.Visualise filters before training, halfway during training, and after training is completed. Normalise the filters before   displaying as an image.

3.Visualise feature maps from the fully-trained network.
